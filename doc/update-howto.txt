0.x to 1.0:
	- Controller moved to de.highbyte_le.weberknecht.Controller. web.xml has to
	  be changed.
	
	- DataAction2 renamed to DataAction. Implementing classes have to be
	  modified.
	
	- Actions that need a database connection, have to implement
	  DatabaseCapable. The old method needsDatabase was dropped.
	
	- replace any ServletException thrown in actions with ActionException
	
	- HttpServletResponse was removed in executes method signature.
	  It shoudn't has been used there, but if so, you have to rewrite your code
	  to access the response via DataActions writeData().
	
	- Action was renamed to WebAction. Change the name in your implementing
	  classes.
	
	- There is a new ActionBase offering onGet and onPost methods.
	  You can extend the new ActionBase and replace your execute with the new
	  methods.
	
	- The generic beans were removed. If they were used, they have to be
	  replaced or copied from a previous release.
	
	- rpx stuff has moved to the rpx-module. Put the module jar into your lib
	  directory, if you need it.
	
	- weberknecht.xml syntax has changed. If you use pre or post processors,
	  the sets do have IDs now. Multiple sets are possible. Now it is possible
	  to assign different sets to certain areas or even actions.
	  
	  If your old config looked like this:
	  	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
		<weberknecht>
			<actions>
				<action name="foo" class="de.highbyte_le.weberknecht.FooAction" />
			</actions>
		
			<pre-processors>
				<pre-processor class="de.highbyte_le.weberknecht.PreProcessor1"/>
			</pre-processors>
			
			<post-processors>
				<post-processor class="de.highbyte_le.weberknecht.PostProcessor1"/>
			</post-processors>
		</weberknecht>
	  
	  You would have to rewrite it like this:
	  	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
		<weberknecht pre="pre1" post="post1">
			<actions>
				<action name="foo" class="de.highbyte_le.weberknecht.FooAction" />
			</actions>
		
			<pre-processors id="pre1">
				<pre-processor class="de.highbyte_le.weberknecht.PreProcessor1"/>
			</pre-processors>
			
			<post-processors id="post1">
				<post-processor class="de.highbyte_le.weberknecht.PostProcessor1"/>
			</post-processors>
		</weberknecht>
  	  
  	  If you have one actions section only it does not matter, if you put the
  	  pre and post attribute on the weberknecht or on the actions element.
