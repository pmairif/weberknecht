0.x to 1.0:
	- Controller moved to de.highbyte_le.weberknecht.Controller. web.xml has to
	  be changed.
	
	- DataAction2 renamed to DataAction. Implementing classes have to be
	  modified.
	
	- Actions that need a database connection, have to implement
	  DatabaseCapable. The old method needsDatabase was dropped.
	
	- replace any ServletException thrown in actions with ActionException
	
	- HttpServletResponse was removed in executes method signature.
	  It shoudn't has been used there, but if so, you have to rewrite your code
	  to access the response via DataActions writeData().
	
	- Action was renamed to WebAction. Change the name in your implementing
	  classes.
	
	- There is a new ActionBase offering onGet and onPost methods.
	  You can extend the new ActionBase and replace your execute with the new
	  methods.
	  
	- the router interface changed. If you implemented your own router, you
	  have to implement the setConfig method.
	
	- The generic beans were removed. If they were used, they have to be
	  replaced or copied from a previous release.
	
	- rpx stuff has moved to the rpx-module. Put the module jar into your lib
	  directory, if you need it.
	
	- weberknecht.xml syntax has changed. If you use pre or post processors,
	  the definition and usage was separated.
	  Sets are defined with <pre-processors-def id="..."> and
	  <post-processors-def id="..."> and applied with <pre-processors ref="" />
	  and <post-processors ref="..." />. Multiple sets are possible and it's
	  possible to assign different sets to certain areas or even actions.
	  Additionally and optionally <actions area="FOO"> changed to <area name="FOO">.
	  
	  If your old config looked like this:
	  	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
		<weberknecht>
			<actions>
				<action name="foo" class="de.highbyte_le.weberknecht.FooAction" />
			</actions>
		
			<pre-processors>
				<pre-processor class="de.highbyte_le.weberknecht.PreProcessor1"/>
			</pre-processors>
			
			<post-processors>
				<post-processor class="de.highbyte_le.weberknecht.PostProcessor1"/>
			</post-processors>
		</weberknecht>
	  
	  You would have to rewrite it like this:
	  	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
		<weberknecht>
			<pre-processors ref="pre1" />
			<post-processors ref="post1" />
			
			<area>
				<action name="foo" class="de.highbyte_le.weberknecht.FooAction" />
			</area>
		
			<pre-processors-def id="pre1">
				<pre-processor class="de.highbyte_le.weberknecht.PreProcessor1"/>
			</pre-processors-def>
			
			<post-processors-def id="post1">
				<post-processor class="de.highbyte_le.weberknecht.PostProcessor1"/>
			</post-processors-def>
		</weberknecht>
  	  
  	  If you have one actions section only it does not matter, if you put the
  	  pre and post attribute on the weberknecht or on the actions element.
