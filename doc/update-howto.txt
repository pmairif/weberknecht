0.x to 1.0:
	- Controller moved to de.highbyte_le.weberknecht.Controller. web.xml has to be changed.
	- DataAction2 renamed to DataAction. Implementing classes have to be modified.
	- Actions that need a database connection, have to implement DatabaseCapable. The old method needsDatabase
	  was dropped.
	- replace any ServletException thrown in actions with ActionException
	- HttpServletResponse was removed in executes method signature.
	  It shoudn't has been used there, but if so, you have to rewrite your code to access the response via
	  DataActions writeData().
	- The generic beans were removed. If they were used, they have to be replaced or copied from a previous release.
	- rpx stuff has moved to the rpx-module. Put the module jar into your lib directory, if you need it.
